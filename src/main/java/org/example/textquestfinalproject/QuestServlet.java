       * That might imply reading several files top to bottom, just to know when we are entering this code block.
       * That happens because view and controller here are tightly coupled.
       * We need to read in depth the internals of the view to understand the controller and make it work.
       * This is true for all high level if statements in this doPost method, as we use strings for actions.
       * Those strings don't tell us clearly about where that action might come from.
       * This is not a problem for the developer that has written the code; he remembers it because he implemented it.
       * However, it is problematic for other developers in the team; also for the author in maybe a couple of months time.

  /*
   * MENTOR COMMENT
   * Using doGet here for the game flow is not recommended for several reasons:
   *
   * Idempotence: GET requests are idempotent, meaning that repeated requests should return the same result
   * and not modify the server state. That makes GET a natural choice when requesting static information
   * that doesn't change based on user input. However, itâ€™s not ideal if the state changes as the user progresses
   * through the game.
   *
   * Data Visibility: GET requests send data via the URL (query parameters), so the user's responses would be visible
   * in the address bar. This could expose game logic or make the URL unnecessarily cluttered. It might also allow
   * users to manipulate the URL and skip ahead or change answers.
   *
   * Caching: GET requests can be cached by browsers, so depending on how you're managing session tracking,
   * this could lead to undesired behavior where the user sees stale game states due to caching.
   *
   * Bookmarking: GET allows for easy bookmarking of pages, but in a game, this may be undesirable because users
   * might bookmark mid-game and disrupt the flow.
   *
   * Bottom line; we should use doPost for all the controller logic in the game.
